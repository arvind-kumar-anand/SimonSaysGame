# Simon Says Game

## Description

The **Simon Says Game** is an interactive memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors by clicking the corresponding buttons. This project was created with a focus on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, providing an engaging user experience while showcasing my skills in Front-end Development.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The game has a clean and intuitive layout, making it easy for users to understand and play.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: The game generates a random sequence of colors that the player must replicate, increasing in difficulty as the player progresses.
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons flash to provide visual cues for both the game and user interactions, enhancing the gaming experience.
- **Game Over Screen**: Displays the user's score and provides an option to restart the game.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the game's layout.
- **CSS**: Applied to style the game, including colors, button sizes, and background images.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented the game logic, including user input handling, sequence generation, and game state management.

## Gameplay
- **Start the game**: Press any key to begin.
- Observe the displayed sequence of colored buttons.
- Click the buttons in the exact order they appeared.
- If you succeed, the game progresses to the next level with an additional random color added to the sequence.

### Mistakes:

- If you click the wrong button or miss a color in the sequence, the game ends.
- You'll see a "Game Over" message showing your final score.
- You can then choose to restart and try again.

## Game Logic

- The game begins with a sequence of zero colors.
- With each successful level completion, a new random color is added to the sequence, increasing the difficulty.
- Players must precisely replicate the displayed sequence to progress.
- Errors trigger the "Game Over" screen with the score.

## Future Improvements

Enhance the user experience with:

- Sound effects for button clicks and game events.
- Varied difficulty levels for customizable challenges.
- Animations and transitions for a more engaging visual design.
- Mobile-friendly optimization for seamless gameplay on various devices.
